# Darth Vader
## Character traits
* dark
* evil
* dangerous
* strong
* force-driven

This is a character I like very much. It is a very dark character, driven to the dark side of the force. Furthermore he is very dangerous and kills a lot of people. Driven by hate, empowered by the force this is a very strong character.
